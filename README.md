# Hello! My name is Matthew

My first exposure to programming was at the age of 10, I developed an interest in multimedia, which in turn led to a series of some fun side projects. This quickly turned into a career which keeps me continually headed down a learning path.
			
I tend to focus on React, NodeJS, and Java/Spring stacks, with a strong emphasis on user experience, I prefer a full stack approach towards projects.
	
When I am not behind the keyboard, you can usually find me cooking, pursuing my interests in art, or hanging out with my children.
